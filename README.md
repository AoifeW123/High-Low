# High-Low

I. Initiative

Overview of the project itself

The project is known as High-Low. High-Low is a game that allows the computer to ask for 

II. Epics and User Stories
Epics
Outlining the main fuctions of the game

The first main function will be to have the computer 

The computer will present you with a random number from 1 – 10 inclusive
Then, the computer will ask “Will you roll higher or lower?” 
The player is asked to predict whether the next number will be of higher or lower
The computer simulates a dice roll on behalf of the player which generates a number from 1 – 10 inclusive
The computer returns the number the dice rolled and a suitable message such as “You Win!” or “You Lose!”
If the dice roll and the computer’s number are the same, the computer displays a message saying “Draw!”
The game then asks the user if they want to play again. If they user types “y” The game starts over. If the user types “n”, the game ends.


Non-Functional Requirements
Asthetic or non essential requirements

User Stories:

As a player, I would like to be able to have the computer ask me for my guess input.

I would like to have the computer create a simulated dice roll that picks a number between 1 and 10.

I would like to see the computer compare my answer to the number generated. After the comparison the computer should respond with either a "You win" or "You Lose". This is unless we both guess the same number then I would exspect to see "Draw!"

I would like to see if after the game has been played if i can play agian or just end the game through an input
